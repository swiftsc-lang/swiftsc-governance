# ⚖️ SwiftSC-Lang Governance Charter

## 🏢 Organization Structure

SwiftSC-Lang follows a **Dictatorship-by-Merit (DbM)** model, where core maintainers make final decisions after public RFC discussion.

## 🗳️ Decision Making Process

1.  **Proposal (RFC)**: Anyone can submit a proposal via a `swiftsc-spec` PR.
2.  **Discussion**: Open for 7 days for community feedback.
3.  **Core Decision**: Maintainers approve, reject, or request changes.

## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines

- All technical changes must follow the **V1.0.3 Stable Architecture**.
- Security-related PRs receive priority in the review queue.

## 🛡️ Security Vulnerabilities

Please report security issues directly to `swiftsc-lang@proton.me` instead of public GitHub issues.
